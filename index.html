                    world, yearns for
                    sustainable development, and this undoubtedly is the reason behind the current consecration of the
                    Sustainable Development Goals [SDGs] the world over. On the other hand, the sine qua non of
                    <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/development-agenda/" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">sustainable development</a> is quality education and, due to this
                    reason, for the world as a whole, and
                    for every single nation in the world, sustainable development cannot be achieved but by people who
                    are able to make informed decisions to meet their own needs and the needs of others in the present
                    time without compromising the needs of future generations. And such people’s ability is the ultimate
                    outcome of no other process than quality education.
                    <br></br>
                    Education Quality is not a dream. It is rather a target that is real and which E&PE Consult®|FGGH
                    strives to make a sure deal for anyone who approaches us in this regard, provided they keep ensuring
                    it is continually being assured, enhanced, assessed and evaluated. The attainment of education
                    quality is actually hampered by a lot of challenges and, for this reason, E&PE Consult®|FGGH is set
                    and determined through its Education Quality Consulting Department to continuously help education
                    providers around the world to elicit what their education quality attainments are up to, and from
                    there suggest them recommended measures through which they themselves can both assure and enhance
                    the quality of their education.
                    <br></br>
                    The objectives pursued by E&PE Consult®|FGGH’s Education Quality Consulting are basically two-
                    pronged in the sense of (1) assessing and establishing for the account of the commissioning
                    organization or institution, body, agent or individual, the status of the situation assigned for
                    analysis in terms of education quality, and (2) suggesting recommended actions to take in order to
                    improve the situational status elicited from the analysis carried out. This implies therefore that
                    E&PE Consult®|FGGH is also competent to provide its clients with suggested measures for both
                    Education Quality Assurance [EQA] and Education Quality Enhancement [EQE]. However, a third
                    objective of E&PE Consult®|FGGH’s Education Quality Consulting emerges from the above- mentioned two
                    ones, and this is (3) to design and implement for the commissioning organization or institution,
                    body, agent or individual, an education professional development program aimed at helping them
                    bridge the education quality gap uncovered from the situation analysis in the first place, and then
                    empower them going forward with the capacity to ensure by themselves their education is both
                    quality-assured and continually quality-enhanced for sustainability purposes. So, in this respect
                    E&PE Consult®|FGGH carries out consultancies that require looking into one, some, or all of the
                    aspects that play a role in determining the quality of education whether Non-Formal or Formal and,
                    particularly regarding formal education or schooling, at any given level among its Pre- Primary,
                    Primary, Secondary or High School, and Tertiary levels.
                    <br></br>
                    In actual fact, all the other four areas in which E&PE Consult®|FGGH offers consulting services —
                    namely Curriculum Development, Review and Revision; Teacher Professional Development; Educational
                    Assessment and Evaluation; Peace Education — are complementary areas expected to be propping up the
                    above-portrayed so important area of Education Quality.
